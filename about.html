                        <strong>Strong Asian Lead</strong> was an educational platform dedicated to empowering Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander (AANHPI) storytellers. Our mission was to equip emerging creatives with the tools, resources, and community to break barriers in Hollywood and redefine the landscape of storytelling. We ran from 2020-2024.

                    <h2 class="section-subtitle">Our Journey</h2>
                    <p>
                        Strong Asian Lead began with a bold vision: to revolutionize Asian American narratives by creating a space where emerging writers and storytellers could thrive. For a time, we provided education, resources, and events that connected creatives with opportunities to share their unique voices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unfortunately, despite our efforts, the challenges of sustaining this mission as a small, resource-constrained organization proved overwhelming. Our initial target audience—up-and-coming creatives early in their careers—was not where we ultimately needed to focus. Without the capacity to pivot in such a competitive and evolving space, we made the difficult decision to close our doors until further notice.

                    <p>
                        To everyone who supported us: the attendees at our events, those who spread the word, and the countless individuals who shared in our vision—thank you. Your belief in our mission and your contributions to our journey have been invaluable.

                        While the work was often challenging for a small team, we grew, learned, and persevered. Mistakes were made, but they became lessons, and those lessons will live on in the future endeavors of our founders.

                    <p>
                        Strong Asian Lead was founded by passionate individuals from Los Angeles who believed in the power of Asian American storytelling. Our founders brought together their diverse backgrounds in film, media, and community organizing to create a platform that would amplify voices often overlooked in Hollywood.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Based in Los Angeles, our team understood firsthand the challenges faced by Asian American creatives in the entertainment industry. We saw the need for a space where emerging storytellers could connect, learn, and grow together.

                        This early demonstration video showcases the initial vision and concept for Strong Asian Lead. 
                        It represents the beginning of our journey to amplify Asian American voices in film and create 
                        opportunities for diverse storytellers in Hollywood.
